## Commands

Project has a Python file with some useful utilities to work in Odoo code files, these are the following:

### dashes

When a Python code file is too long, reorder the code in blocks divided by horizontal rules makes more easy read them.

This command replaces selection by a dashed line with selected text in center. The result is like the following:

```python
    # ------------------------------- PRUEBA ----------------------------------
```

- Line starts at the selection beginning and ends in the column 79.
- Text will have two spaces, one before and another after.
- If there is not selected text when command is invoked, line will be printed without any text.

### finddashes

Once the Python code file has been divided by horizoantal rules, will be very useful to jump to the next line of dashes. This command does just that.
